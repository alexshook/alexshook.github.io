    <p>I don’t know if it’s all the nostalgia for the 90s going around lately, but I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of conversations with other developers that got me thinking about my early years in web development. Back in 1998 I made tons of random websites with hilarious CSS, absolutely insane JavaScript, and crazy background wallpapers. I made them mostly with Geocities and Angelfire, and they were part of so many web rings.</p>

<p>I had lots of sites, but my main sites were my Xanga and LiveJournal. Those were the ones people actually knew about because everyone had a Xanga or a LiveJournal, or sometimes both like I did. I remember them being like mini-social networks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit harder to remember when I made the first app or app-like thing. I don’t think it got made until 2001 or 2002 because around then I  managed to get my own domain name for free. I think I got it by taking a survey about the internet. Can’t remember the specifics though.</p>

<p>I had been getting tired of the design constraints of Xanga— there was only so much you could do with it. The thing I made is considered a pretty classic first app these days: a blog app. Thing. App-thing. I say app-thing because it wasn’t exactly an app— it was a tiny bit of PHP with some vanilla JavaScript thrown in to make it easier to use. It had no database and I’m 99% sure it wrote directly to some files on wherever I was hosting it. It had no admin view, but it did have basic auth and wow was that ever unsafe because it sent the password in plaintext.</p>

<p>This was before the days of responsive, so it had a fixed layout made of a big image and a smaller repeating background image that I blended into a solid background color. Most likely I used tables to line everything up correctly. Clicking the link to add a new post resulted in a pop up window, which sounds horrifying now, though I remember it as standard for the early 2000s. Later on I got fancy and added pagination and an edit post option. There was also a basic commenting system that I made from scratch.</p>

<p>To this day, I have no idea how I pulled it off with the knowledge I had at the time. I wish I still had the code, but it disappeared with my beloved old Gateway 2000.</p>
