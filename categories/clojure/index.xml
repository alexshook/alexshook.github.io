      <description>This year, I was supposed to learn Clojure. I told myself that I was going to. I had been planning to pick up another language that is very different from Ruby and round out my skillset a bit.
Over the past few years a bunch of people have told me that I would probably like Lisp. I’ve also been reading a book in Scheme, and Clojure’s pretty much close enough. A bit more useful for web stuff, too.</description>
