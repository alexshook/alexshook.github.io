      <description>I don’t know if it’s all the nostalgia for the 90s going around lately, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bunch of conversations with other developers that got me thinking about my early years in web development. Back in 1998 I made tons of random websites with hilarious CSS, absolutely insane JavaScript, and crazy background wallpapers. I made them mostly with Geocities and Angelfire, and they were part of so many web rings.</description>

      <description>My first code blog was built on Octopress 2. It was a great starter blog, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make some changes for a while. I got tired of waiting for Octopress 3, so I&amp;rsquo;m relaunching with Hugo, which looks like it has an active community and some great documentation.
I had planned on migrating my posts, but decided on a fresh start instead.
Hello, world.</description>
