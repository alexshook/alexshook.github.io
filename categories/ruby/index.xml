      <description>More than a year ago I tweeted (with a broken link to my old Octopress) about going through Learn Ruby the Hard Way again because I never finished it. I went up to #44 and stopped because I have no ideas for games, and #45 is the make a game exercise.
I started again last fall and am up to #11. At least I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to keep the completed exercises in a GitHub repo so I don&amp;rsquo;t lose them in the depths of my computer.</description>
