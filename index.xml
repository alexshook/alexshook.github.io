      <title>Learn Ruby the Hard Way Again</title>

      <description>More than a year ago I tweeted (with a broken link to my old Octopress) about going through Learn Ruby the Hard Way again because I never finished it. I went up to #44 and stopped because I have no ideas for games, and #45 is the make a game exercise.
I started again last fall and am up to #11. At least I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to keep the completed exercises in a GitHub repo so I don&amp;rsquo;t lose them in the depths of my computer.</description>

      <description>My first code blog was built on Octopress 2. It was a great starter blog, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make some changes for a while. I got tired of waiting for Octopress 3, so I&amp;rsquo;m relaunching with Hugo, which looks like it has an active community and some great documentation.
I had planned on migrating my posts, but decided on a fresh start instead.
Hello, world.</description>

      <description>Hello! I’m Alex. I write code. Mostly Ruby, JavaScript when I need something fancy in a browser. ClojureScript for fun and profit. This blog uses Hugo and I keep meaning to make more than a terminal app in Go.
I’ve been writing code ever since I turned eleven and an owl didn’t deliver my Hogwarts letter. I never got a toad and a phoenix feather wand (Pottermore says it&amp;rsquo;s apple/phoenix feather), but creating with code is close to magical.</description>
